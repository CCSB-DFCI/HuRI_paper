#Rosa

``rosa`` is a C++ library to process PDB file in the "classical" (obsolete) pre-2014 PDB format.

The package also includes a set of command line tools to perform some standard operations (superposition, alignment,
extraction of subsets of atoms, etc...).

The libary has grown through the years and, given the fact that it handles an obsolete PDB file format, it is provided
as-is and it won't be updated in the future.
