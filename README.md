# HuRI manuscript code

This repository contains the code to generate the figures for the paper: 

[K Luck, DK Kim, L Lambourne, K Spirohn, *et al*. “A Reference Map of the Human Binary Protein Interactome.” *Nature* 580, no. 7803 (April 2020): 402–8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2188-x)

The code often reads from our internal databases, and so is not fully reproducible off-site but serves as
documentation.

Most of the code is in Python 3.7, with some R, Matlab and other scripts.
