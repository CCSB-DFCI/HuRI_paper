# HuRI manuscript figures

This repository contains the code to generate all the figures for the human reference interactome paper.
The code often reads from our internal databases, and so is not fully reproducible off-site but serves as
documentation.

Most of the code is in Python 3.7, with some R, Matlab and other scripts.
